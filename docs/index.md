# COMBAT-TB Workbench

## Introducting the COMBAT-TB Workbench Interface

The COMBAT TB Workbench can be installed locally using Docker and docker-compose, please see
the [online instructions](https://github.com/COMBAT-TB/irida-galaxy-deploy).

Alternative, you can use an instance of the Workbench that has already been deployed, for example
to access the demo workbench at SANBI [click here](http://ctb-workbench.sanbi.ac.za/).

The Workbench is designed to work with all modern web browsers (for example Firefox, Edge and Chrome).

For an introduction to the operation of the workbench, see this [video](https://youtu.be/M4IHPqQWC9Q)

Once you log in to the Workbench, you will see a landing page.
